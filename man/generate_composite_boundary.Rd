\title{Generate a composite stream temperature signal with diel and annual components}
\usage{
generate_composite_boundary(
  n_years = 1,
  dt = 3600,
  T_mu = 10.5,
  A_annual = 8,
  A_diel_mean = 2.2,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_years}{Numeric, duration in years (default 1).}

\item{dt}{Numeric, time step in seconds (default 3600 = hourly).}

\item{T_mu}{Mean annual temperature (default 10.5 degC).}

\item{A_annual}{Annual amplitude (default 8.0 degC).}

\item{A_diel_mean}{Mean diel amplitude (default 2.2 degC).}

\item{A_diel_mod}{Seasonal modulation of diel amplitude (default 1.8 degC).}

\item{phi_diel_hour}{Hour of daily peak temperature (default 15 = 3 PM).}

\item{phi_annual_day}{Day of year for annual peak (default 200, late July).}
}
\value{
A zoo object with time index in seconds from start, suitable
  for use with fit_ols, fit_fft, or as boundary condition input.
}
\description{
Creates a synthetic hourly temperature time series that mimics real stream
temperature data, with amplitude-modulated diel cycles nested within a
seasonal (annual) envelope. Parameters are derived from Meacham Creek
Channel 3 observations.
}
\details{
The signal model is a diel cosine whose amplitude is seasonally modulated
(larger in summer, smaller in winter), superimposed on an annual cosine.
This creates a realistic amplitude-modulated signal whose FFT contains
the fundamental diel and annual peaks plus sidebands at 1/day +/- 1/year.
