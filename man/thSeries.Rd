\title{Generate synthetic temperature time series (forward model)}
\usage{
thSeries(signal, xVals, tVals, specificUnits)
}
\arguments{
\item{signal}{A thSignal object containing transport and boundary parameters.}

\item{xVals}{Numeric vector of sensor depths (m). Must include 0 (boundary).}

\item{tVals}{Numeric vector of time values (s) at which to evaluate.}

\item{specificUnits}{A thUnits object. Must match the signal units.}
}
\value{
A temperheic S3 object (class thSpecifiedSeries/thSeries/temperheic)
}
\description{
Given a thSignal object (which encapsulates aquifer, hydrology, and boundary
conditions), generates temperature time series at specified depths using the
analytical solution to the 1D advection-diffusion equation (Luce et al. 2013,
Eq. 6):
}
\details{
T(z,t) = T_mean + A * exp(-z / thermDecayDist) *
           cos((2*pi/P) * (t - phase - z/phaseVel))

Also computes pairwise amplitude ratios, phase differences, depth
differences, and eta values for all sensor combinations.
