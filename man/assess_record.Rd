\title{Assess whether a temperature record supports fitting at a target period}
\usage{
assess_record(
  x,
  period,
  max_gap_frac = 0.17,
  min_cycles = 2,
  gap_threshold = 3,
  min_segment_duration = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A zoo object (single-column). Index should be numeric (seconds)
or POSIXct.}

\item{period}{Numeric: target period in seconds. Common values:
86400 (diel), 31557600 (annual = 365.25 * 86400). No default; user
must specify.}

\item{max_gap_frac}{Numeric: maximum tolerable gap as a fraction of
\code{period}. Default 0.17 (~9 weeks for annual period, per Johnson et al.
2021; ~4.1 hours for diel). Set to 0.25 if imputation will be applied.}

\item{min_cycles}{Numeric: minimum contiguous record length expressed as
multiples of \code{period}. Default 2.0 (Nyquist/Rayleigh minimum for FFT).
Use 1.5 for OLS-only, 3.0 for confident estimates. For diel windowed
analysis, consider 5.0+ to ensure enough cycles for a full analysis
window.}

\item{gap_threshold}{Numeric: multiplier on median sampling interval to
detect gaps. Default 3. A gap is flagged when consecutive observations
are separated by more than \code{gap_threshold * median(diff(index))}.}

\item{min_segment_duration}{Numeric or NULL: optional absolute minimum
segment duration in seconds. When non-NULL, a segment must meet both
\code{min_cycles * period} and \code{min_segment_duration} to be classified as
"sufficient". Useful for diel analysis where windowed fitting requires
a minimum number of days regardless of cycle count. Default NULL
(no absolute floor; classification depends only on \code{min_cycles}).}

A list with class \code{"record_assessment"} containing:

      \code{seg_id}, \code{start}, \code{end}, \code{duration_s}, \code{n_obs}, \code{cycles}
      (duration / period), \code{verdict} ("sufficient", "marginal",

    \item{overall_verdict}{Character: "sufficient" if any segment meets
      \code{min_cycles} (and \code{min_segment_duration} if set), "marginal" if

\description{
Examines a zoo time series for gaps and total length relative to a target
period (diel, annual, or arbitrary). Returns a diagnostic tibble describing
contiguous segments, gap locations and durations, and a per-segment verdict
on whether the record is sufficient for OLS or FFT fitting.
}
\details{
The assessment applies two period-relative criteria, plus an optional
absolute duration floor:

**Maximum gap tolerance** (\code{max_gap_frac}): The longest permissible gap as
a fraction of the target period. Gaps shorter than this are tolerable
(interpolation is defensible); gaps longer than this split the record into
separate contiguous segments. Default 0.17 (\eqn{\approx} 62 days for annual),
based on Johnson et al. (2021) finding that up to 7--9 consecutive weeks of
missing data still yields accurate annual sine-wave parameter estimates.

**Minimum record length** (\code{min_cycles}): The minimum number of complete
target-period cycles a contiguous segment must span. Segments shorter than
\code{min_cycles * period} are flagged as insufficient.

**Minimum segment duration** (\code{min_segment_duration}): An optional absolute
floor on segment duration in seconds, independent of cycle count. When set,
a segment must satisfy \emph{both} \code{min_cycles} and \code{min_segment_duration}
to be classified as "sufficient". This is particularly useful for diel
analysis, where \code{min_cycles = 5} yields a 5-day minimum, but the user may
want to enforce a longer minimum to ensure enough data for windowed fitting
(e.g., \code{min_segment_duration = 7 * 86400} for 7-day windows).

Default thresholds and their basis:
\itemize{
  \item \code{max_gap_frac = 0.17}: 62 days / 365 days. Johnson et al. (2021)
    showed OLS sine fits remain accurate with up to ~9 weeks missing
    (without imputation). With imputation, tolerance extends to ~13 weeks
    (0.25 of period).
  \item \code{min_cycles = 1.5} (OLS minimum): Below 1.5 cycles, the seasonal
    curvature is confounded with trend and amplitude is poorly constrained.
  \item \code{min_cycles = 2.0} (FFT minimum): The Rayleigh criterion requires
    \eqn{\geq 2} cycles to resolve a frequency as a distinct spectral peak.
  \item \code{min_cycles = 3.0} (recommended): Empirical rule of thumb for
    reliable amplitude estimates (\eqn{\pm \sim 10\%}).
}

**Gap detection:** A gap is any interval between consecutive observations
that exceeds \code{gap_threshold} times the median sampling interval. The default
multiplier of 3 catches instrument outages while tolerating occasional
missing hourly records.

**Diel analysis considerations:** For windowed diel analysis (e.g., using
\code{window_temperature()} with 5--7 day windows per Vogt et al. 2012 and
Gariglio et al. 2013), the practical minimum segment length is governed by
the window width, not the cycle count alone. A segment of 3 diel cycles
(3 days) satisfies \code{min_cycles = 2.0} but is too short for a 5-day analysis
window. Use \code{min_segment_duration} to enforce the window-width floor:

\preformatted{
  # Diel assessment requiring 7-day minimum segments for windowed fitting
  assess_record(z, period = 86400, min_cycles = 5.0,
                min_segment_duration = 7 * 86400)
}

The default \code{max_gap_frac = 0.17} translates to \eqn{\approx 4.1} hours
for diel period. This is a reasonable tolerance: a gap shorter than
~4 hours leaves most of the diel sinusoid constrained for OLS fitting
within each window. Longer gaps (e.g., 10+ hours) lose substantial
curvature information and should split the record. Note that
\code{window_temperature()} has its own \code{min_coverage} parameter that
provides within-window gap checking; \code{assess_record()} provides the
complementary record-level diagnostic.
