\title{temperheic S3 Objects: Aquifer, Boundary, Hydro, Signal, and Units}
\usage{
.thSpecificUnits(generalUnits, specificUnits = thUnits())
}
\arguments{
\item{generalUnits}{Character vector of general unit expressions.}

\item{specificUnits}{A thUnits object with specific labels.}
}
\value{
Character vector of specific unit strings, same length as generalUnits.
}
\description{
Core domain objects for the temperheic package. Each constructor builds
an explicit named list with class attributes for type checking and printing.
}
\details{
Object hierarchy (composition, not inheritance):
  thUnits    -- unit labels (shared by all objects)
  thAquifer  -- sediment/water material properties
  thHydro    -- flow parameters + derived transport properties (contains thAquifer)
  thBoundary -- temperature signal at the boundary
  thSignal   -- wave propagation characteristics (contains thHydro + thBoundary)
Replace general unit symbols (L, M, t, T, E) with user-specified labels.

Each element of generalUnits is a space-separated string like "E t-1 L-1 T-1".
The function substitutes the specific unit labels from a thUnits object,
preserving exponents.
