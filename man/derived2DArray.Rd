\title{Build a named square matrix from a pairwise comparison vector}
\usage{
derived2DArray(x, seriesNames)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of length n^2 (pairwise values)}

\item{seriesNames}{Character vector of length n (sensor/depth names)}
}
\value{
A named n x n matrix with dimnames "from" (rows) and "to" (columns)
}
\description{
Takes a vector of length n^2 (from expand.grid permutations of n sensors)
and reshapes it into an n x n matrix with labeled rows and columns.
Used by thObservedSeries to organize amplitude ratios, phase differences,
eta values, and depth differences into sensor-pair matrices.
